# DIRV_robotic_arm
Designed a 4 Degree of Freedom (DOF) Robotic Arm that uses a Novel Vacuum Gripper mechanism, which gave us the flexibility to operate on objects of different shapes, sizes, and materials. The robotic arm collected & sorted balls based on color, moreover, it performed that task with significantly Fewer Joints and Reduced Firmware Size compared to a traditional claw based robotic arm. The arm and respective sensors were interfaced with the Shakti E-Class RISC-V Core.
